# featured as using the lxmd program to host a
# propagation node. For complete control and
# flexibility, use lxmd to run a PN. For a
# small local system or network, the built-in
# PN functionality will suffice for most cases.
#
# If there is already a large amount of
# propagation nodes on the network, or you
# simply want to run a pageserving-only node,
# you should disable running a propagation node.
# Due to lots of propagation nodes being
# available, this is currently the default.

# For clients and other propagation nodes
# delivering messages via this node, you can

# stamp costs. All messages delivered to the

# Clients automatically detect the stamp cost
# for the node they are delivering to, and
# compute a corresponding stamp before trying
# to deliver the message to the propagation
# node.
#
# Propagation stamps are easier to verify in
# large batches, and therefore also somewhat
# easier to compute for the senders. As such,
# a reasonable propagation stamp cost should
# be a bit higher than the normal peer-to-peer
# stamp costs.
#
# Propagation stamps does not incur any extra
# load for propagation nodes processing them,
# since they are only required to verify that
# they are correct, and only the generation
# is computationally costly. Setting a sensible

# checking the average network consensus) helps

# node network.

# Or specify more advanced options. This
# example works well for small thermal-
# roll printers:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o cpi=16 -o lpi=8

# This one is more suitable for full-sheet
# printers. It will print a QR code at the center of any media
# your printer will accept, print in portrait mode, and move the message to
# the top of the print queue:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o job-priority=100 -o media=Custom.75x75mm -o orientation-requested=3

# But you can modify the size to fit your needs.
# The custom media option accepts millimeters, centimeters, and
# inches in a width by length format like so:
# -o media=Custom.[WIDTH]x[LENGTH][mm,cm,in]
#
# The job priority option accepts 1-100, though you can remove it
# entirely if you aren't concerned with a print queue:
# -o job-priority=[1-100]
#
# Finally, the orientation option allows for 90 degree rotations beginning with 3, so:
# -o orientation-requested=4 (landscape, 90 degrees)
# -o orientation-requested=5 (reverse portrait, 180 degrees)
#
# Here is the full command with the recommended customizable variables:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o job-priority=[N] -o media=[MEDIA_SIZE] -o orientation-requested=[N] -o sides=one-sided

# For example, here's a configuration for USB thermal printer that uses the POS-58 PPD driver
# with rolls 47.98x209.9mm in size:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o job-priority=100 -o media=custom_47.98x209.9mm_47.98x209.9mm -o sides=one-sided
